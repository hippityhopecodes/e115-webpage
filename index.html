    <h2>Programming & Learning Resources</h2>
    <p> As a senior in Computer Science, a lot of topics can be frustrating to learn or get a grasp on.
        Here are some resources that I have found helpful in my time at NC State!
    </p>

        <tr bgcolor="grey" width="700">
            <th>Resource</th>

        <tr bgcolor="lightgrey" align="center">
            <td>
                <strong>The Organic Chemistry Tutor</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
                A great resource for learning math and science topics, especially chemistry, calculus, and physics.
                He has a lot of free YouTube videos and practice problems that are very helpful, probably wouldn't have passed my pre-reqs without him!

                <strong>Bro Code</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
                My go-to for every programming language I have learned so far (HTML/CSS, Java, C, Python).
                His YouTube videos are much more digestible than some of my professors' lectures!

            <td>
                A great website for practicing coding problems, especially for interviews.
                It has a wide range of problems and solutions in Python and Java (some others too maybe?).
                Highly suggested if you are intimidated by <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/" target=_blank title="LeetCode link">LeetCode</a> (use the free version)!

            <td>
                A great website for learning web development, data science, back end development, etc.
                It has a lot of free courses and tutorials that are very beginner-friendly, kinda janky UI though.
